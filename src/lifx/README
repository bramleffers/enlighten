Place the LIFX directory in your Code Composer Studio's workspace directory and import.

Full Disclosure:
- I copied the LIFX directory out of my C:\Users\Craig\Documents\workspace_v6_1\LIFX directory on 05/13/2015.
- I did not clean the building system, as to preserve any binaries, in the event that this project does not
   import as intended.
- I forced git to add the object files and binaries even though they are gitignored.
